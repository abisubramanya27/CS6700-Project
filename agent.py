"""

DO not modify the structure of "class Agent".
Implement the functions of this class.
Look at the file run.py to understand how evaluations are done. 

There are two phases of evaluation:
- Training Phase
The method "learn" is invoked here. Use this phase to train your agents.

- Test Phase
The methods "registered_reset" and "compute_action" are invoked here. 
The final scoring is based on your agent's performance in this phase.
